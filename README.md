# Elite-Drive

My project focuses on a ride booking system. Upon launching, the main menu appears, offering options for Rider, Driver, and Admin roles. To register as a driver or rider, users must provide their CNIC (13 digits) and phone number (11 digits), along with an email address. 

**For Riders**:After registration, riders enter their pickup and drop-off locations. The estimated fare is calculated using a graph-based algorithm. Riders also specify the number of passengers, and a car from a linked list is assigned based on the entered capacity. All rides are stored in a linked list.

**For Drivers**: Upon registration, the driverâ€™s name is stored in a file along with their phone number, CNIC, and email address. When a rider requests a ride, a driver is randomly assigned from the file.

**Admin**: Admins can view records of both drivers and riders and access feedback submitted by riders. The admin credentials are:< br / >
Username: "dsaa"< br / >
Password: "dsaa.project"< br / >

Riders can provide feedback after their ride, enhancing service quality. The admin can review all feedback, allowing for monitoring and improvements.
